# Traffic-Singnals-Image-Classification

## Data Collections
There are around 58 classes and each class has around 120 images. the labels.csv file      has the respective description of the traffic sign class. You can change the assignment of these classIDs with descriptions. We can use the basic CNN model to get      decent val accuracy. We have around 2000 files for testing.

## Tech Stack Used
    Python
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Open-Cv
    Tensorflow
    Keras
    Pre-trained Models
    Streamlit
    Google Colab
    Visual Studio
    
## Deployment using Streamlit Steps
* Create folder
* Add saved model to the created folder
* Copy the folder link
* Open it using command prompt using cd command
* Write next command (code .) it will open vs code with specified folder
* Create a virtual environment using terminal or command prompt
* Steps for creating virtual environment
* Using conda  : conda create -n envname python=x.x(python version
* Activate using :conda activate venv(virtual environment name)
* Using python for command prompt : python venv venv-name
* Activate using : environment name\Scripts\activate
* Now install all the required library inside venv
* Run the streamlit using streamlit run appname.py
